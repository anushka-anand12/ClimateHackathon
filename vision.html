      </h1>
      <p id = "vblurb"> We wanted to create a solution that allows for the visualization of factors related to ships, ports and their impact on Norweigan waters. Our ideas stemmed from having visual experiences aid our education. Seeing how there is not much visual data on how ships affect parts of our world, we wanted to create something that can be used as a learning tool on this subject. Using this methodology, we envisioned an educated community through data analysis and imagery solutions.  </p>
